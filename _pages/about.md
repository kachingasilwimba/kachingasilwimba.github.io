I am a data scientist and Ph.D. Candidate in Computing (Data Science) at [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/), based in the [School of Computing](https://www.boisestate.edu/computing/). I specialize in artificial intelligence, machine learning, [high-performance computing (HPC)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hpc), data engineering, hydrology, and climate data science.

My research focuses on building scalable deep learning models for [computer vision](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/computer-vision), climate, and hydrological systems. I work extensively with land surface models, such as [CLM5](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/clm), applying advanced machine learning techniques to emulate complex simulations with reduced computational cost. A core part of my work involves [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification), enabling more trustworthy model predictions, particularly in high-risk or data-scarce regions.

I place strong emphasis on [interoperability](https://www.ogc.org/about/interoperability/), ensuring that models, data formats, and computing workflows can integrate smoothly across tools, platforms, and disciplines. From developing machine learning surrogates that plug into scientific workflows to managing geospatial data pipelines that serve diverse users, my work supports open, modular, and collaborative science.

I am passionate about bridging scientific research with practical solutions, using AI, geospatial modeling, and data engineering to tackle real-world challenges in climate adaptation, water resource management, and environmental prediction. Through reproducible, interdisciplinary research, I aim to make complex models more accessible, explainable, and impactful.

## <span style='color:#0077cc;'>Research Interests</span>

- **Machine Learning Emulators for Climate Models**  
  I develop deep learning surrogates (e.g., [CNNs](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/convolutional-neural-networks), [LSTMs](https://developer.nvidia.com/discover/lstm)) to emulate complex climate simulations such as CLM5. These models significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining physical fidelity, enabling faster and scalable climate scenario analysis.

- **Uncertainty Quantification & Interpretability**  
  I apply evidential deep learning to quantify prediction uncertainty in climate and hydrological models. Tools like [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Sobol indices](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.sobol_indices.html) help ensure that model outputs are transparent, interpretable, and scientifically robust.

- **Geospatial Pattern Analysis**  
  My work involves identifying and analyzing spatial climate patterns using machine learning and statistical techniques. I implement scalable workflows using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and [Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs)](https://ajdawson.github.io/eof2/eofs.html) in Python/[Dask](https://www.dask.org/) to detect anomalies and validate climate models.

- **High-Performance Computing (HPC) & Big Data**  
  I optimize environmental data workflows on multi-node GPU-accelerated clusters using tools like Dask, [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html). This includes efficient job scheduling, parallel processing, and large-scale data engineering for climate and Earth system modeling.

- **Hybrid Climate Modeling with AI**  
  I explore integrated modeling approaches that combine physics-based climate models (e.g., CLM5, [WRF](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf)) with machine learning. This hybrid methodology improves prediction reliability and supports actionable insights for climate mitigation and decision-making.
