**Impact of Soil Hydraulic Parameter Variability on Soil Moisture: An Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis**   
Published: February 6, 2025  

Summary:    
This article employs Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to elucidate how variations in soil hydraulic parameters underpin significant differences in soil moisture simulations. The work highlights the uncertainty introduced by different parameterization schemes and calls for improved representations of soil properties in land surface models.

**Can Foot-Flush Reduce Cholera Spreading?**   
Published: December 5, 2024  

Summary:  
Drawing on my undergraduate thesis, I proposed a foot-operated toilet valve to reduce hand contact with surfaces and curb the transmission of cholera. Inspired by pandemic-era hands-free designs, the mechanism promises affordability and ease of adoption, pending sponsorship for prototyping.

**Africa Needs More Investment in Climate Action**   
Published: December 3, 2024  

Summary:  
Highlighting a US$52.7 billion annual funding gap for adaptation, Kachinga Silwimba warns that underinvestment leaves African nations vulnerable to droughts, power crises, and other climate-related risks. He urges stronger collaboration between researchers and policymakers to secure the resources needed for effective mitigation and resilience.
