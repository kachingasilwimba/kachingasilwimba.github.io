I am a data scientist and Ph.D. candidate in Computing (Data Science) at [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/), specializing in [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [high-performance computing (HPC)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hpc), hydrology, and [climate data science](https://climate.nasa.gov/). My research develops scalable AI and  deep learning models for [computer vision](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/computer-vision) and Earth system simulations, with a focus on [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification) and efficient emulation of physics models like [CLM5](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/clm). I prioritize [interoperability](https://www.ogc.org/about/interoperability/), ensuring that tools, data, and models integrate smoothly across disciplines. I build reproducible workflows and modular machine learning surrogates that support open, collaborative science. Driven by real-world impact, my work bridges the fields of AI and environmental research to address challenges in climate resilience and water resource management.

## <span style='color:#0077cc;'>Research Interests</span>

- **Machine Learning Emulators for Climate Models**  
  I develop deep learning surrogates (e.g., [CNNs](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/convolutional-neural-networks), [LSTMs](https://developer.nvidia.com/discover/lstm)) to emulate complex climate simulations such as CLM5. These models significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining physical fidelity, enabling faster and scalable climate scenario analysis.

- **Uncertainty Quantification & Interpretability**  
  I apply evidential deep learning to quantify prediction uncertainty in climate and hydrological models. Tools like [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Sobol indices](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.sobol_indices.html) help ensure that model outputs are transparent, interpretable, and scientifically robust.

- **Geospatial Pattern Analysis**  
  My work involves identifying and analyzing spatial climate patterns using machine learning and statistical techniques. I implement scalable workflows using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and [Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs)](https://ajdawson.github.io/eof2/eofs.html) in Python/[Dask](https://www.dask.org/) to detect anomalies and validate climate models.

- **High-Performance Computing (HPC) & Big Data**  
  I optimize environmental data workflows on multi-node GPU-accelerated clusters using tools like Dask, [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html). This includes efficient job scheduling, parallel processing, and large-scale data engineering for climate and Earth system modeling.

- **Hybrid Climate Modeling with AI**  
  I explore integrated modeling approaches that combine physics-based climate models (e.g., CLM5, [WRF](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf)) with machine learning. This hybrid methodology improves prediction reliability and supports actionable insights for climate mitigation and decision-making.
